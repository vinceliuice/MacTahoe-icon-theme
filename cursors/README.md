## Building from source

You'll find everything you need to build and modify this cursor set in
the `src/` directory. To build the xcursor theme from the SVG source
run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

By default, cursors are built without any shadows. You can enable them with:

```bash
./build.sh --with-shadow
```

This will generate the pixmaps and appropriate aliases.
The freshly compiled cursor theme will be located in `dist/`
